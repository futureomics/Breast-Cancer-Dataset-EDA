Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Breast Cancer dataset using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. 
EDA is applied to this dataset to learn more about the correlations between various factors and the distribution of these variables among patients. EDA is essential to cancer research because it may be used to find patterns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in data analysis where it helps Data Analysts and researchers represent the data visually and dig patterns from data to obtain deep knowledge ingrained in the dataset.
The EDA is done using the visualization tools of Python and the observations from the data are represented using relevant plots and tabulations.
